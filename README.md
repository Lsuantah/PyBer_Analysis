# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this project is to provide exploratory analysis on PyBer data to help the company improve ride-sharing services.  We will create summary DataFrames of the ride-sharing data by city type which will be used to create charts to show relationships between city type, riders and the fare paid by city type.

## Results:


The results showed a distinctive trend between ride fares and city type. The Urban cities fare appear to be the highest and consistent month by month. Urban city also had most riders among all city types.  The Rural city has the least number of riders and the lowest fare when compared to Urban and Suburban city types. 
From the results, the best recommendation will be to consider investing more resources in the Urban and Suburban cities.
